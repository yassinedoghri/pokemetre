# Pokémètre

Pokémètre is a console that matches you with one of the 1300+ Pokémon known to
existence.

This state of the art console uses advanced algorithms to find the perfect
Pokémon for you: input your height and weight, and let Pokémètre's cutting-edge
technology do the rest!

## Context

Pokémètre is a personal project developed during
[SvelteHack 2024](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/2024) and using
[PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) data.

Pokémètre was created for fun, and to try out new tools:

- 🚀 Svelte 5 w/ SvelteKit
- ✨ TypeScript
- 🗄️ Sqlite3 w/ Drizzle ORM
- 🔀 XState
- 💅 Tailwind CSS

What I have learned in practice:

- Svelte Runes
- Finite State Machines (FSM) using xState
- Styling and animating complex components (ie. DPad, display screen)
